# üìñ Choose Your Own Adventure: An AI-Powered Interactive Story

Welcome to the **Choose Your Own Adventure** game! This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with LangChain and LangGraph to create a dynamic, interactive storytelling experience where your choices directly shape the narrative and your character's fate. Built with Streamlit, it provides a user-friendly interface to embark on endless adventures.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Storytelling:** The narrative adapts in real-time based on your decisions.
* **Dynamic Choices:** LLM-generated choices keep the story fresh and unpredictable.
* **Persistent Character State:** Your character's health, inventory, and location are tracked throughout the game.
* **Health System:** Your character's health decreases with each turn, leading to a "Game Over" if it drops to zero. Specific choices can also affect health.
* **Plot Flags:** Internal mechanisms to remember past events, influencing future interactions (e.g., finding a secret, examining an item).
* **Modular Agent Design:** Utilizes LangGraph for a robust and traceable state machine, managing the flow of the game logic.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and engaging web UI built with Streamlit.

## üöÄ How to Play

1.  **Start Your Journey:** Click "Start New Game" to begin your adventure in a mysterious forest.
2.  **Read the Story:** The AI will describe your current scene and situation.
3.  **Make a Choice:** Select one of the available actions presented at the bottom of the screen.
4.  **Observe Consequences:** Your health will decrease with each turn. Your choice will lead to a new part of the story, potentially changing your location, inventory, or health.
5.  **Survive!** Keep an eye on your health. If it drops to 0, your adventure ends, and you'll be prompted to start a new game.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+** (Recommended)
* **Google API Key** for Gemini (or another LLM provider like OpenAI, if configured).
    * You can get a Google API Key from the Google AI Studio: [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME # Replace YOUR_REPO_NAME with your actual repository name
    ```
    (If you've just pushed, you'll skip cloning and just `cd` into your project directory.)

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit
    langchain
    langchain-google-genai
    langgraph
    langchain-core
    pydantic==1.10.13 # Pinning for compatibility
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set up your Google API Key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and add your API key:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    **IMPORTANT:** Make sure this `.env` file is listed in your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being accidentally committed to your public repository!

## üöÄ Running the Application

Once everything is set up, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
```

## üí° Future Improvements
**More Complex Inventory:** Implement item usage, combining items, or persistent effects.
**Combat System:** Introduce turn-based combat with enemies, damage calculations, and different attack options.
**Dialogue System:** NPCs with branching dialogue trees.
**Saving/Loading Game:** Persist game state across sessions.
**Enhanced Plot Flags:** More intricate branching storylines and consequence tracking.
**Error Handling:** More graceful handling of LLM generation failures.
**More Diverse Locations/Encounters:** Expand the world with more unique places and events.
**Sound/Music:** Add audio elements for immersion.
